# My [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org) Configuration

Kakoune is an interesting editor. [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) was heavily inspired by it.

## Try it out!

I have Kakoune setup in a specific way, which requires external dependencies to access features such as
fuzzy finder, Git UI via LazyGit, file explorer, etc. Read the `kakrc` to learn about specific dependencies.

Make sure that you have the editor downloaded and installed on your system. Then, install
[Kakoune LSP](https://github.com/kakoune-lsp/kakoune-lsp) and clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nizamiza/kak.git ~/.config/kak
```

Start hacking!
